    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Biryani is a delicious rice dish peppered with scrumptious spices like saffron and cumin and further layered with spiced meat or veggie protein.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>

<li>4 small potatoes, peeled and halved</li>

<li> large onions, finely chopped</li>

<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

<li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>

<li>2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>

<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

<li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>

<li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

<li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>

<li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>

<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>

<li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>

<li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>

<li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</li>
    </ul>

 <h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Wash the basmati rice. Before you begin cooking, you need to wash the rice. Fill a large bowl with cold water and pour in the rice. Use your hand to stir the rice in one direction. The water should get cloudy, so pour off the cloudy water. Refill the bowl with water. Continue rinsing the rice until the water is clear.</li>
    <li>Soak the rice. After you have you rinsed the rice, soak it. Place the rice in a bowl of cold water and let it soak for 30 minutes to 2 hours.[1] Soaking the rice helps the grains expand and be fluffy.
        You can soak the rice in the water you plan on boiling it in. If you do this, then the amount of water you need to use is 1.25 times the amount of rice. For 2 cups of rice, use 2 1/2 cups of water.</li>
    <li>Chop the vegetables. If you are adding mixed vegetables, such as carrots, beans, tomatoes, cauliflower, or peas, cut them into smaller pieces. Make sure you wash the vegetables and set them aside, ready to be added to your rice.</li>
